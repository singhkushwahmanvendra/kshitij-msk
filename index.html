                        Kshitij also called KTJ, is the annual techno-management festival
                        of one of India’s premier technical institutions, the IIT Kharagpur.
                        Kshitij’s journey started in 2004, from then its aim is to provide the
                        technically inclined youth’s generation a national-level platform,
                        where they can show their talents and expertise and would be recognized
                        and rewarded. Since its early years, Kshitij developed exponentially,
                        it gets an overpowering response from the students from various famous
                        technical institutes and educational communities everywhere throughout the world.
                        Not only from India but students from foreign countries are getting attracted
                        toward Kshitij and are actively participating in its events creating a more competitive,

                        instructors from every one of the fields, from chief Mr. Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra, Brigadier Stephen Tetlow
                        to ISRO space researcher Dr. K.Radhakrishnan. For the sake of entertainment, Kshitij 2017 had different casual
                        occasions like the Bull ride, Water Zorbing, Drone recreation, and Bahubali VR. Kshitij 2017 experienced
                        Infinity Mirror Clock from the USA, Robyn Inmoon from Sweden, 3D printed robots from the USA, Molecular
                        VR structure the UK, U Gears Mechanical Models from Ukraine and indeo from India in its displays.

                        Workshops from tech goliaths like Toyota, Oracle, LIGO were directed for this present year. PRAKRITI
                        and ASTITVA were 2 of the social activities taken for the current year by Kshitij. PRAKRITI was tied
                        in with dealing with the expanding strong waste and ASTITVA was for helping understudies handle mental
                        despondency which was presented by Indian on-screen character Tisca Chopra.
